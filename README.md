EuleKids is the dream to make educational technology a universal right.
 

EulerKids is a free, adless, educational [single page application](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) 
written in Javascript. It relies on [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework for the backend and uses 
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store exercises, app usage and user progress. HTTP requests are proxied by 
[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). The frontend is written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and uses 
[Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for styling.

The art has been created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and provided by [Rubi Villanueva](https://github.com/rubivg).
